            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And therefore his Maiestie in his Princely wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and vpon necessity of State, sees it fit, that from hencefoorth all care and diligence in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and all seuerity in the correction and punishment of such delinquents, without fauour to any, shall be vsed. And to the end that all men may take notice heereof, his Maiesty thinketh fit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this his Proclamation, to the end that no man vpon hope of impunity, presume heereafter to transgresse his Maiesties Laws, or this his Royall commandement in that behalfe; heereby straitly charging and commanding, that no person or persons, alien, denizen, or other subiect, of what estate, degree, quality or condition soeuer, do at any time heereafter, without his Maiesties licence, transport, carry, or conuey, or attempt, or endeuour to transport, carry or conuey out of this Realme, any golde or siluer, either in Coine, Plate, Vessels, Iewels, Goldsmiths worke, Bullion, or other Masse, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise howsoeuer, vpon paine of his Maiesties heauy indignation and displeasure, and of the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest censure of his high Court of Starre-chamber, and such further paines, punishments and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments, as by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme may be inflicted vpon them for such their offence.</p>
            <p>And further, that no person or persons whatsoeuer, vpon the like paines or penalties, do ayd, assist, counsaile, or any waies partake with any other person or persons, purposing or attempting to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, carry or conuey out of this Realm, without his Maiesties lycense, any Gold or Siluer, in Coyne, Plate, Vessell, Iewels, Goldsmithes worke, Bullion, or other masse, or otherwise howsoeuer; either by gathering or getting together such Gold or Siluer, or by packing vp the same fit for transportation, or conueying the same to or towards any Port, Hauen, or other place of exportation, or by any other way, meane, or colour whatsoeuer. And that all &amp; singuler Goldsmiths, Merchants, &amp; their Factors, Masters of ships, Mariners, Passengers‚ñ™ and all other persons whatsoeuer, that shall haue any

And for auoyding of all vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consumption and waste of Siluer and Gold within this Realme, which is much practised of late by some Goldsmithes and Refiners, and those that vse the manufacture of Gold and Siluer threed; His Maiestie doth hereby straitly charge and command, that no Finer of Gold or Siluer, nor parter of the same by fire or water, from henceforth allay no fine Siluer, nor Gold, nor none sell in any other wise, ne to any person or persons, but only to the Officers of his Maiesties Mynts, Changes, and Goldsmithes within this Realme, only for the augmentation and amending of Coyne and Plate: And that no Finer nor Finers, Parter nor Parters sell to no person any manner of Siluer in Masse molten and allayed; and that no Goldsmith within this Realme melt or allay any fine Siluer, but only for making of Amels and for amending of Plate, to make it as good as sterling, as by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in that case is prouided: Nor that they sell no fine Siluer, nor other Siluer allayed, molten into Masse to any person or persons whatsoeuer, nor one Goldsmith to another: But that the Statute in this behalfe made in the fourth yeere of His Maiesties most noble progenitor King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth be in all points duly obserued and kept, vpon paine that euery person, offending to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, shall incurre His Maiesties High indignation and displeasure, and such punishment as by the Law or by His Maiesties Prerogatiue Royall may be inflicted for such misdemeanor &amp; contempt.</p>
            <p>And for that the making of Gold and Siluer threed is found to be a great waste &amp; consumption of Coyne &amp; Bullion of the Realme, Therfore His Maiestie doth further prohibite &amp; forbid all making of Gold and Siluer threed, of what kind soeuer, or by whatsoeuer name it be called within this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Realme: And doth straitly charge and command, that no person or persons whatsoeuer, from the feast of Saint Michael the Archangell next ensuing, shall presume to buy, or put to sale any Gold or Siluer threed, made within any His Maiesties Dominions, vpon paine to incurre the vttermost seueritie of the censure and punishments afore mentioned.</p>
